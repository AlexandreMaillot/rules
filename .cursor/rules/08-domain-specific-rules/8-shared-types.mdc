# Shared Types Standards

## Context
- These rules apply to all shared types in the monorepo
- Shared types are used for data transfer between frontend and backend
- They ensure type consistency across the entire application

## Requirements

### Structure
- All DTOs must be defined in the shared-types package
- DTOs must be organized by domain/feature
- Each DTO must have a clear purpose and documentation
- Shared DTO between backend and frontend

### Naming Conventions
- Use suffix appropriate to the purpose (e.g., `UserDTO`, `CreateUserDTO`)
- Keep names consistent with domain terminology
