design_patterns:
  progressive_disclosure:
    definition: organize_from_simple_to_complex
    description: "Present information in layers, starting with core concepts and progressively revealing details"
    examples:
      - "Starting with high-level overview before diving into specifics"
      - "Using expandable sections or hierarchical organization"
    implementation:
      - "Main concepts first, details later"
      - "Increasing complexity as the document progresses"
  
  content_separation:
    definition: distinguish_process_from_knowledge
    description: "Clearly separate cognitive processes (how to think) from knowledge content (what to know)"
    examples:
      - "Workflow sections for processes (Ω)"
      - "Knowledge bases (KB) for reference content"
    implementation:
      - "Use different section types for processes vs. knowledge"
      - "Reference external knowledge rather than embedding it"
  
  cognitive_scaffolding:
    definition: build_conceptual_framework_first
    description: "Create mental structures that support understanding before adding details"
    examples:
      - "Starting with categories and taxonomies"
      - "Defining relationships between concepts before details"
    implementation:
      - "Use hierarchical structures (↹) to organize concepts"
      - "Provide visual frameworks (diagrams) when helpful"
  
  symbolic_consistency:
    definition: maintain_notation_throughout
    description: "Use symbols and notation consistently across all rules"
    examples:
      - "Same symbols for same concepts across all rules"
      - "Consistent formatting and visual styling"
    implementation:
      - "Document symbol meanings in a central location"
      - "Verify notation consistency during validation"
  
  knowledge_integration:
    definition: reference_external_sources_appropriately
    description: "Link to external knowledge rather than replicating it"
    examples:
      - "References to KB files instead of copying content"
      - "Clear citation of source materials"
    implementation:
      - "Use @file, kb:path, or kb_path + 'file' notation"
      - "Extract reusable content to KB files"
