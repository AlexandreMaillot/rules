- Add suffix for file type or purpose
- Match file name to main export

Classes and Interfaces:
- Use PascalCase for names
- Use nouns or noun phrases
- No prefix or suffix for class/interface
- Add descriptive suffix for specific types

Functions and Methods:
- Use camelCase for names
- Use verbs for actions
- Use nouns for value-returning
- Prefix booleans with is, has, should
- No anemic models

Variables and Properties:
- Use camelCase for names
- Use plural for arrays/collections

Constants:
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Scope constants appropriately
- Group related constants in enum or object
