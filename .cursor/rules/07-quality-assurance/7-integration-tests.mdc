# Testing Integrations Tests

## Data
- List input data (DTO)
- List expectations of output
- Follow testing flow path from input controller to deep services until output expected data

## External API calls
- Mock external API calls, mocking external data result
- Make sure those external calls are called with valid input data

## Asynchronous commands
- Since commands can be launch and async, we need to check:
  - command has been launched
  - results are correctly emitted back
