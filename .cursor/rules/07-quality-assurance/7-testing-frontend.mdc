# Frontend Testing Standards

## Mock
- Only mock external calls (like API, `window` object from browser etc).

## Errors
- Test that errors are correctly throws
- Do not check `console` output

## Components and state
- Never test "dumb" components
- Always generate tests for store and smart components
- Ensure state is checked
