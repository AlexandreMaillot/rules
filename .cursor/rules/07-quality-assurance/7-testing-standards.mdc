# Testing Standards

## Organization
- Files by feature for specific domain
- Group related tests in `describe`

## Core testing
- Use English
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Action based testing to test real user interactions.

### Common Rules
- Name tests descriptively
- Do not create types, use existing or ask user where they are if not found.
