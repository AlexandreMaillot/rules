# React Framework Standards

## Component Structure
- Functional Components
- Light and small
- Strongly props typing

## Splitting
- Split in sub-components by responsibility
- If component is shared, move it outside component folder.
- If component is only for the parent component, create sub-component.
- Follow smart/dumb component pattern -> React components are dumb

## State
- State and logic are deported in a dedicated place (smart component)
- Declare vars on top of component for tiny calculation (dump component)
- `displayName` at bottom
- No default export
- Returns `null` if mandatory props do not exist
- One component per file, except for tiny private component for readability

## Style and Accessibility
- Mobile first
- Use existing UI components
- Semantic HTML elements
- Proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation
