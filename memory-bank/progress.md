# Progress

## Purpose

This document tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## Current Status

Project is in the initial setup phase. Memory bank has been initialized with project documentation. Ready to begin implementation of the VS Code extension.

## What Works

- **Project Planning**: Complete, with clear requirements and architecture defined
- **Memory Bank**: Initialized with comprehensive documentation
- **Technical Research**: Completed research on VS Code extension development and GitHub API

## What's Left to Build

- **Project Scaffolding**: High priority, need to initialize the VS Code extension project
- **GitHub API Service**: High priority, core functionality for fetching repository data
- **TreeView Implementation**: High priority, for displaying repository structure
- **Checkbox Functionality**: Medium priority, for selecting files
- **Download Mechanism**: Medium priority, for saving selected files
- **Error Handling**: Medium priority, for robust user experience
- **Testing**: Low priority initially, will become higher as features are implemented

## Known Issues

- **No Issues Yet**: Project implementation has not started

## Recent Milestones

- [2025-04-03]: Project requirements and architecture defined
- [2025-04-03]: Memory bank initialized with comprehensive documentation

## Upcoming Milestones

- [Target: 2025-04-04]: Initial project scaffold with basic GitHub API integration
- [Target: 2025-04-05]: TreeView implementation with repository browsing
- [Target: 2025-04-06]: File selection and download functionality
- [Target: 2025-04-07]: Complete testing and refinement

## Evolution of Decisions

- **Extension Structure**: Initial plan for complex folder structure → Simplified structure based on Yeoman generator, for better alignment with VS Code conventions
- **API Client**: Considered third-party GitHub API clients → Decided on native Node.js https module, to minimize dependencies
- **UI Approach**: Considered custom WebView → Decided on native TreeView, for better integration with VS Code

## Performance Metrics

- **Not Yet Available**: Will be tracked once implementation begins

## Testing Status

- **Not Yet Started**: Testing will begin after initial implementation

## Deployment History

- **No Deployments Yet**: Project is in planning phase

## Notes

The project is well-positioned to begin implementation with a clear understanding of requirements and architecture. The focus will be on creating a clean, maintainable codebase that follows VS Code extension best practices. The incremental development approach will allow for regular testing and refinement throughout the process.
